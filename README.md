# IoT Based Switchboard

This project is an IoT-based smart switchboard that allows users to **control home appliances** through a **web application** as well as **manual switches**. It uses the **ESP8266 (NodeMCU)** microcontroller, relays, and a simple web interface to toggle appliances from anywhere via Wi-Fi.

---

## 🔧 Features
- Remote control of appliances through a **web dashboard**  
- Manual ON/OFF control using physical switches  
- Real-time status update of each load  
- Wi-Fi-based communication using **ESP8266**  
- Low-cost and easy to integrate with any switchboard  
- Supports multiple loads (bulb, fan, plug point, etc.)

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements
- NodeMCU ESP8266  
- 4-channel relay module  
- Manual switches  
- Power supply (5V)  
- Connecting wires  
- Appliances/load  

---

## 💻 Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE  
- ESP8266 Board Manager  
- Web browser  
- HTML/CSS/JS for web interface  

---

## 🚀 Working Principle
1. **ESP8266** connects to a Wi-Fi network.  
2. The **web application** communicates with ESP8266 through HTTP requests.  
3. ESP8266 triggers the **relay module**, turning appliances ON/OFF.  
4. Manual switches can also control loads without affecting IoT functionality.
