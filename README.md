# 🌐💡🏠 IoT-Based Switchboard

## 📄 Project Overview
The IoT-Based Switchboard is a smart home automation system designed to give users control over their electrical appliances both remotely and manually. Using NodeMCU (ESP8266) as the main controller, the system allows you to turn devices ON/OFF via a web application or physical switches, making it perfect for modern smart homes.

## ⚙️ Features
- Remote control of multiple appliances through a web interface
- Manual control using physical push-button switches
- Real-time appliance status monitoring
- Lightweight and energy-efficient using NodeMCU
- Easy installation and setup for smart home and industrial automation

## 🛠️ Hardware Components
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- 5V/12V Relay Modules
- Push Button Switches
- Power Supply
- Connecting wires and PCB

## 💻 Software Components
- Arduino IDE (programming NodeMCU)
- Web interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Optional IoT platform like Blynk for remote control

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Connect relay modules to NodeMCU and appliances.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to NodeMCU.
3. Access the web application to control appliances remotely.
4. Use physical switches for manual control if required.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- Voice control integration (Alexa, Google Home)
- Energy consumption monitoring
- Scheduling and automation rules for appliances
